👋 Hello! I’m Sherry Lee.


I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Design, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence, at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.


I’m interested in programming, problem-solving, designing, creativity and gaming so I am naturally drawn to the world of game development and AI. I aspire to be a game developer and develop games that will provide impactful experiences to the players.


My repositories here consist of personal projects & school projects.
