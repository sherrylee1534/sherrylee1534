ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Sherry Lee.


I graduated from Singapore University of Technology and Design with a degree in Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science and Design), with a minor in Artificial Intelligence.


Iâ€™m interested in programming, problem-solving, designing, creativity and gaming so I am naturally drawn to the world of game development and AI. I like to develop games during my free time, and read up on the latest news on technology.


My repositories here consist of personal projects & school projects.
