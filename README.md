ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Sherry Lee.
<p> I'm a Computer Science and Design undergraduate studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. </p>
<p> Iâ€™m interested in programming, problem-solving, designing, creativity and gaming so I am naturally drawn to the world of game development. I aspire to be a game developer and 
develop games that will provide impactful, entertaining experiences to the players. </p>
<p> My repositories here consist of personal projects (games) & school projects (apps). </p>
