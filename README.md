ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Sherry Lee.


I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Design, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence, at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.


Iâ€™m interested in programming, problem-solving, designing, creativity and gaming so I am naturally drawn to the world of game development and AI. I like to develop games during my free time, providing impactful experiences to the players.


My repositories here consist of personal projects & school projects.
